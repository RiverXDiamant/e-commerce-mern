# MERN Stack eCommerce site

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies Used
### `HTML`
### `CSS`
### `SASS`
### `JavaScript`
### `MongoDB`
### `Express`
### `React`
### `Nodejs`
## Approach Taken

I mapped out the steps I would take to create a Full Stack APP using Notion.
I created a HTML mockup of the app to use as a guide when implementing it in React.

## User Stories
<ul>
<li><p>The most important lesson I learned when building this project, is not to assume that something can be easily implemented. Breaking my project into even smaller pieces and researching first whether the technologies used when creating the mockup can be utilized with MERN stack; If they can't, then research and document how I will be able to.</p></li>

<li><p>Keeping track of every problem encountered and solution for reference. Takes notes of everything!</p></li>
<li><p>Adding notes to the code; I like to create a .txt file for every project I am working on so that I can keep notes of fixes, problems and future changes I would like to make.</p></li>
</ul>
